Wind Turbine Fault Predictor
Description
The Wind Turbine Fault Predictor is an advanced machine learning project designed to anticipate potential wind turbine failures by analyzing historical operational data. By identifying subtle patterns indicative of faults versus normal operations, the system enhances predictive maintenance strategies, thereby reducing downtime and associated costs. Leveraging neural networks for accurate predictions, the project aims to improve the overall efficiency and reliability of wind turbine operations.

Developed collaboratively on GitHub, this project ensures reproducibility and encourages community engagement. It also emphasizes long-term data preservation and integration with real-time monitoring systems.
